# Control Message Documentation

The control message is a JSON object used in the Morpheus pipeline workflow. It is wrapped in a `ControlMessage` object and passed between the Morpheus stages.

## Components

The primary component `inputs` are used to group control messages together, treating them as if they were inputs in a pipeline. In the form of an array, the inputs component is made up of individual control message objects, each representing a distinct input to the pipeline. Each control message object has the following structure:

### Control Message
```
{
  "tasks": [
    // Array of task objects
  ],
  "metadata": {
    // Metadata object
  }
}
```

#### Tasks

The tasks component of each control message object is an array of task objects, each of which represents a separate task to be executed on the input data. Each task object has the following structure:

```
{
  "type": "string",
  "properties": {
    // Properties object
  }
}
```


- `type` : The type field of the task object is a string indicating the type of task to be executed. Currently, the following task types are supported:

  - `load` : Load input data from a specified file or files
  - `training` : Train a machine learning model on the input data
  - `inference` : Perform inference using a trained machine learning model on the input data

- `properties` : The properties field of the task object is an object containing task-specific properties. The specific properties required for each task type are described below.

  - The properties object for a `load` task has the following structure:
    ```
    {
      "loader_id": "string",
      "files": [
        "string"
      ]
    }
    ```

    - `loader_id` : The ID of the loader to be used for loading the input data. Currently, only the `fsspec` and `file_to_df` loaders are supported. The user has the option to register custom loaders in the dataloader registry and utilize them in the pipeline.
    - `files` : An array of file paths or glob patterns specifying the input data to be loaded.

  - Incorporate key and value updates to properties objects as required for `training` and `inference` tasks. There is no specified format.

### Metadata
The metadata component of each input object is an object containing metadata information. Properties defined in this metadata component can be accessed anywhere across the stages that consume `ControlMessage` objects.

- `data_type` : which is a string indicates how to process the data. The supported data types are:
    - `payload` : Arbitrary input data
    - `Streaming` : Streaming data

## Example

This example demonstrates how to add various parameters to control message JSON. Below message contains an array of three task objects: a `load` task, a `training` task, and an `inference` task. The `load` task loads input data from two files specified in the files array to a dataframe using the fsspec loader. The `training` task trains a neural network model with three layers and ReLU activation. The `inference` task performs inference using the trained model with ID `model_001`. The metadata component of the input object indicates that the input data type is `payload`.

```json
{
    "inputs": [
        {
            "tasks": [
                {
                    "type": "load",
                    "properties": {
                        "loader_id": "fsspec",
                        "files": [
                            "/path/to/file1",
                            "/path/to/file2"
                        ]
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "training",
                    "properties": {
                        "model_type": "neural_network",
                        "model_params": {
                            "num_layers": 3,
                            "activation": "relu"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "type": "inference",
                    "properties": {
                        "model_id": "model_001"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "metadata": {
                "data_type": "payload"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
